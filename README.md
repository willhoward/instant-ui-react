# Instant - Lean React UI Library

## Getting Started

Install `instant-ui-react` in your project by running `npm install instant-ui-react` if you use NPM or `yarn add instant-ui-react` if you use Yarn.

Add components to your React app by importing them from the package as follows:

```
import { Button } from 'instant-ui-react';
```

The library is intended to be as quick and straightforward to use as possible. As a result, it's deliberately simple in construction and opinionated in styling.

To view the available components, head to [instant-ui-react.com](https://instant-ui-react.com).
